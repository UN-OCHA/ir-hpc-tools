INTRODUCTION
------------

The Link Icons module is a field formatter for the Link field to display an
icon for the service being linked to - ex. Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn, with
various display options available as settings of the formatter. The icons
themselves are provided from the Font Awesome project.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The link field module, obviously, and the Font Awesome module that adds the FA
project to Drupal allowing the icons to be displayed:
 * Link (https://drupal.org/project/link)
 * Font Awesome (https://drupal.org/project/fontawesome) (at least version
   7.x-2.6)

Don't forget to add/upgrade to the latest version of Font Awesome in your
sites/all/libraries/fontawesome directory.


INSTALLATION
------------
Install as you would normally install a contributed drupal module. See:
https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for further
information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
 * Just head to a content type display management tab
   (ex. http://yoursite.com/admin/structure/types/manage/yourtype/display) where
   you have a link field/fields. In the format column for the link field that
   you want to use this formatter, select the 'Service icon (with options)'
   format, and save the form to put it into use.
 * Click the settings cog/gear button to view and edit the (hopefully)
   self-explanatory options for how the links should be displayed. These exploit
   most of the Font Awesome features, as listed at
   http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/
 * To customise the icons further, just theme your pages as usual. With the
   icons rendered as text characters using Font Awesome, you can style them with
   CSS as you wish.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
 * Try clearing all your caches using the performance configuration page should
   you encounter any issues.
 * Edit the settings for the problematic field, using the cog/gear button, to
   flush out any invalid settings from previous versions of this module.
 * Don't forget to add/upgrade to the latest version of Font Awesome in your
   sites/all/libraries/fontawesome directory.


FAQ
---
None, yet.
